# Architecture
To better understand how this project is set up, this guide should help you understanding the basics of the project. 

The Recipes App is separated between three different sections, "frontend", "backend", and "firebase". 

## Frontend
The frontend is served to the client using Vite, React, TailwindCSS, and Typescript. 

## Backend & API
To allow for the app to use AI to evaluate recipes based on user entered ingredients, the backend is created with Python, and FastAPI. 

## Firebase
Is used for the database to store users and other information.
